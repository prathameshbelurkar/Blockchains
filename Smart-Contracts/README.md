<br>

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible.

Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.

While blockchain technology has come to be thought of primarily as the foundation for bitcoin​, it has evolved far beyond underpinning the virtual currency.

- Smart contracts are self-executing lines of code with the terms of an agreement between buyer and seller automatically verified and executed via a computer network.

- Smart contracts deployed to blockchains render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.

Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting and communicating without being controlled by a central authority. There is no need to hand over all your personal details to use Ethereum - you keep control of your own data and what is being shared. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used to pay for certain activities on the Ethereum network.

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Among cryptocurrencies, ether is second only to bitcoin in market capitalization.

Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Additional founders of Ethereum included Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin. In 2014, development work began and was crowdfunded, and the network went live on 30 July 2015. Ethereum allows anyone to deploy permanent and immutable decentralized applications onto it, with which users can interact. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks, such as allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for interest. Ethereum also allows users to create and exchange NFTs, which are unique tokens representing ownership of an associated asset or privilege, as recognized by any number of institutions. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies utilize the ERC-20 token standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin offerings.

## Decentralized Applications (Dapps)

<br>

<br>

A decentralized application (dapp) is an application built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. On Ethereum, smart contracts are accessible and transparent – like open APIs – so your dapp can even include a smart contract that someone else has written

A dapp has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers.

A dapp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) to make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can get hosted on decentralized storage such as IPFS.

- Decentralized - dapps operate on Ethereum, an open public decentralized platform where no one person or group has control

- Deterministic - dapps perform the same function irrespective of the environment in which they get executed

- Turing complete - dapps can perform any action given the required resources

- Isolated - dapps are executed in a virtual environment known as Ethereum
  Virtual Machine so that if the smart contract has a bug, it won’t hamper the normal functioning of the blockchain network

## Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM's)

<br>

</p>

<br>

The EVM’s physical instantiation can’t be described in the same way that one might point to a cloud or an ocean wave, but it does exist as one single entity maintained by thousands of connected computers running an Ethereum client.

The Ethereum protocol itself exists solely for the purpose of keeping the continuous, uninterrupted, and immutable operation of this special state machine. It's the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live. At any given block in the chain, Ethereum has one and only one 'canonical' state, and the EVM is what defines the rules for computing a new valid state from block to block.

</p>

<br>

Gas refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network.

Since each Ethereum transaction requires computational resources to execute, each transaction requires a fee. Gas refers to the fee required to conduct a transaction on Ethereum successfully.

Gas fees are paid in Ethereum's native currency, ether (ETH). Gas prices are denoted in gwei, which itself is a denomination of ETH - each gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH (10-9 ETH). For example, instead of saying that your gas costs 0.000000001 ether, you can say your gas costs 1 gwei. The word 'gwei' itself means 'giga-wei', and it is equal to 1,000,000,000 wei. Wei itself (named after Wei Dai, creator of b-money) is the smallest unit of ETH

## Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAO's)

<br>

A DAO is a collectively-owned, blockchain-governed organization working towards a shared mission.

DAOs allow us to work with like-minded folks around the globe without trusting a benevolent leader to manage the funds or operations. There is no CEO who can spend funds on a whim or CFO who can manipulate the books. Instead, blockchain-based rules baked into the code define how the organization works and how funds are spent.

They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice, and everything happens transparently on-chain.

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure that has no central governing body and whose members share a common goal to act in the best interest of the entity. Popularized through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain technology, DAOs are used to make decisions in a bottoms-up management approach.

- A decentralized autonomous organization is an entity structure in which tokenholders participate in the management and decision-making of an entity.

- There is no central authority of a DAO; instead, power is distributed across tokenholders who collectively cast votes.

- All votes and activity through the DAO are posted on a blockchain, making all actions of users publicly viewable.

- One of the first DAOs named The DAO was an organization created by developers to automate decisions and facilitate cryptocurrency transactions.

- A DAO must ensure security is prioritized, as exploits can leave a DAO drained of millions of dollars of its treasury savings.

## Initial Coin Offerings (ICO's)

<br>

An initial coin offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry’s equivalent of an initial public offering (IPO). A company seeking to raise money to create a new coin, app, or service can launch an ICO as a way to raise funds.

Interested investors can buy into an initial coin offering to receive a new cryptocurrency token issued by the company. This token may have some utility related to the product or service that the company is offering or represent a stake in the company or project.

- Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a popular way to raise funds for products and services usually related to cryptocurrency.

- ICOs are similar to initial public offerings (IPOs), but coins issued in an ICO also can have utility for a software service or product.

- A few ICOs have yielded returns for investors. Numerous others have turned out to be fraudulent or have performed poorly.

- To participate in an ICO, you usually need to first purchase a more established digital currency, plus have a basic understanding of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges.

- ICOs are, for the most part, completely unregulated, so investors must exercise a high degree of caution and diligence when researching and investing in them.

<br>

**How an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Works:**

When a cryptocurrency project wants to raise money through an ICO, the project organizers’ first step is determining how they will structure the coin. ICOs can be structured in a few different ways, including:

- **Static supply and static price:** A company can set a specific funding goal or limit, which means that each token sold in the ICO has a preset price, and the total token supply is fixed.

- **Static supply and dynamic price:** An ICO can have a static supply of tokens and a dynamic funding goal—this means that the amount of funds received in the ICO determines the overall price per token.

- **Dynamic supply and static price:** Some ICOs have a dynamic token supply but a static price, meaning that the amount of funding received determines the supply.
